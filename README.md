# CDK & Lambda Sandbox

Some sandbox experiments with Lambda Functions and CDK.  Based on the simple serverless app example at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/serverless_example.html

CDK stack expects to find aws creds in ~/.aws/credentials

Borrowed a lot of project setup suggestions from:
